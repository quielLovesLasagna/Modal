# Modal

Repository name: Modal

Description:
This repository contains a simple example of a modal popup implemented in JavaScript and HTML. Modal popups are commonly used in web development to display additional information or forms without navigating away from the current page. In this project, we create a modal that opens and closes when a button is clicked, demonstrating a basic understanding of event handling.

Key Features:
1) Modal popup that appears when the "Open Modal" button is clicked.
2) Close the modal by clicking the close button.

Getting Started:
To use this modal popup example in your project, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Open the index.html file in your web browser to see the modal in action.
3) To integrate it into your own project, copy the HTML structure and JavaScript code from index.html and script.js respectively. Make sure to include the necessary CSS styles for the modal to display correctly.
